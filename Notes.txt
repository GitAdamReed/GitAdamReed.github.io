NOTE ABOUT LOSS VALUE: Loss value implies how well or poorly a certain model behaves after each 
iteration of optimization. Ideally, one would expect the reduction of loss 
after each, or several, iteration(s). The accuracy of a model is usually determined 
after the model parameters are learned and fixed and no learning is taking place
