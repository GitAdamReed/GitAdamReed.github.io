                <h1>Dissertation Project</h1>
                <p>
                    This program was made as part of my dissertation. The goal of 
                    this dissertation was to create a Q-Learner that moves around 
                    an environment, collecting items, and with each iteration gets 
                    better at the task until it has reached a point where it performs 
                    the task perfectly. This would prove that Q-Learning, which is a 
                    form of artificial intelligence, can be used to train an AI agent 
                    to play a simple game perfectly. Even though the goal was not 
                    fully achieved, Q-Learning was still implemented. It controlled 
                    a player sprite which collected items and behaved differently in 
                    certain states.

                <p>
                    The Q-Learner works by collecting values in each state which it is in. 
                    A state in this case is a X and Y coordinate. These values, called Q-values, 
                    are placed in a table which in future iterations of the environment, are 
                    used to make decisions based on a certain state. The program also, to 
                    aid the Q-Learner, scans for nearby items when one is collected and gives 
                    some information to the Q-Learner. The Q-Learner is timed so to measure 
                    if it is improving or not with each iteration of the environment. Once 
                    the Q-Learner has collected every item in the current iteration, the time 
                    is recorded by the program and a new iteration is started.

                    This is one of the first fully functional python games I have made. 
                    pygame was used to develop this project. It is based on the card game Blackjack. 
                    The player must beat the dealer 
                    by having a higher score, each card in a hand has a value assigned to it 
                    which makes up the score. If the score of the player or dealer is 
                    greater than 21, the opponent wins. If a card has a number, that is 
                    the value of the card. If the card is a Jack, Queen or King, the value 
                    is 10. An Ace can be 1 or 11 depending on the circumstances. 
                    The way it is coded here is that if the players hand value is greater 
                    than 11, an Ace is only worth 1, this prevents automatically “busting” the hand.

                    The player, as displayed onscreen, can press enter to “hit” or 
                    get another card, and can press space to “stand” or receive no 
                    more cards and let the dealer play. Each new card is displayed 
                    slightly to the right of the last to clearly show the full hand.

                    The player should stand when they think they have a strong enough 
                    hand to beat the dealer. In this example, the player has stood at a 
                    hand value of 17. When the player stands, the dealer then plays and 
                    receives cards in an attempt to beat the player. Here we can see 
                    that the dealer got lucky this time and got a hand value of 18. 
                    In this instance, the player loses.

                    The player can also lose by busting. This is when a hand has a value 
                    greater than 21. Here we can see the player hit and busted. The player 
                    then automatically loses, and the dealer wins.

                    Alternatively, the player can win if the dealer busts. In the image shown, 
                    the dealer attempts to beat the player but ends up drawing a seven from the 
                    deck. This makes their hand value equal to 25, which is above 21, so they bust 
                    and the player wins.
